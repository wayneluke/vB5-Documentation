Modules are the building blocks of vBulletin 5 Connect's Site Builder system. Using Modules the site administrator can control the content that is displayed on pages throughout the system. There are two types of modules. Admin Modules and System Modules. Admin Modules are the ones that the administrator can add, edit, and delete from pages. They can be used to create custom pages for a variety of reasons. Using the options provided, they allow the site administrator to change how pages look and work, giving them design control over the site and what it does. 

## How to Add a Module
In the course of running a website, there are times that users will ask for features that you didn’t originally consider. VB5 has made it easy for you to add and remove modules depending on your needs and the needs of your users. To add a module to a page, make sure the Site Builder is turned on and click on the Edit Page button. From here you can drag and drop whatever module you want in to the existing page.

After adjusting the settings for the module and placing it where you want, click on the Save Page button to save your changes. That’s it, it’s that simple.

## How to Remove a Module from a Page

It’s not easy predicting what your users want. Sometimes what we (and they) think will be really useful, turns out to be the opposite of that. Luckily, Site Builder makes removing the modules easy. When you have Site Builder turned on, click on the Edit Page button along the top. The modules on the page will revert to a more compact look like so:

To remove the module from the page, click on the little garbage can icon to the right of the edit icon.  The module will be removed from the page, however the changes will not be saved until you click Save Page and complete the process.

## How to Edit a Module
Modifying a module’s settings is just as easy as adding it or removing it from your page. Again, make sure that Site Builder is turned on before clicking on the [button]Edit Page[/button] button. From here, click on the pencil icon to the left of the delete icon. Each module has its own individual settings form that will pop up. After making the adjustments you want to the module, click the [button]Save Changes[/button] button at the bottom of the form.

## How to Change the Positioning of the Modules

Changing the position of your modules is a very simple process. First, make sure the Edit Site function is turned on before clicking on the Edit Page button. Once the Page Editor has opened, use the directional icons to move the modules to its new location. When you’re finished adjusting the positioning of the modules, click on the Save Page button. This will save any change you’ve made return you to the page you edited.
