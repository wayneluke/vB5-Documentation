**Site Builder** is the newest innovation in vBulletin’s line of site management products. It allows an administrator user, with the correct permissions, to change and edit the content and look of their site without logging in to the **AdminCP**. Where **Site Builder** deals with the outward facing portion of a site, the **AdminCP** controls the nuts and bolts of the system. 

The **Site Builder** allows an administrator to add various functionalities, dictate what they do, and where they’re placed on the site. It can control how your navigation bar is organized as well as which HTML ads appear in your header, and what the site logo is.

To see a list of available modules that you can use on your pages see the [Module List](/site_builder/pages/add_modules).

Everything else is controlled and administered using the [AdminCP](/admin_control_panel). 

## Accessing Site Builder
If you’re an Administrator in vBulletin 5, you might have noticed a new button to the right of your login. This button lets you access the Site Builder. The Site Builder lets you create new pages, and add and remove modules to existing pages. It also allows you to edit the header, the footer and the navigation bar.

The first step in customizing pages on your site is to turn Site Builder on. To do that, just click the <button>Edit Site</button> button. This will reveal a new menu items at the top of the page, like this:

The new items are the commands for Site Builder. These are: Channels, Style, Pages, New Page, Edit Page, Header, Navigation Bar, and Footer. Each option controls and edits a different part of your site. Clicking on a button will open and reveal the related tools.

## Style
Select <button>Style</button> to open and use the Style Manager. The Style Manager allows you to set the look of your site. This tool has two options available within it. Using the Style tab, you can select one of the themes installed in your vBulletin and set it as the site default theme. vBulletin comes with a number of themes to select from. The other tool is to modify the CSS of your current theme. CSS is for more advanced users and allows additional modifications to look and feel of the site. [More Information](/site_builder/styles)

## Channels
Channels are containers for your site's content. These include Forums, Blogs, Article Sections, and Social Groups. The Channels tool allows you to quickly add or delete channels from your site. However for more advanced features, you'll need to use the Channel Manager within the AdminCP.

## Pages
Pages are used to display content or system controls throughout your site. There are two types of pages in vBulletin. System Pages and Custom Pages. System pages cannot be removed and may contain modules (content blocks) that are required for that page. However, System Pages can be edited and have optional modules added or removed to customize the page. You can also create Custom Pages. These can be added and deleted and may contain any number of modules. You can access your custom pages by clicking on the Pages link.

## New Page
Clicking on this control will enable you to add a new custom page to your site.

## Edit Page
Click on this control will allow you to edit the page you are currently viewing.

## Header {#header2}
The header is global and any changes will appear on all pages. Using the Header tool, you can change your logo or place advertising above the page. The header cannot contain additional modules at this time.

## Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar is also global and will appear on all pages, though the exact display can change depending on where you are. With the Navigation Bar editor, you can create up to two layers of navigation. This includes the primary navigation tabs and a sub-navigation that can be assigned to each tab. Changes here will affect all Styles.

## Footer {#footer2}
The footer is the final global component on the site. Using the footer tool, you can add custom links to the bottom of your pages. In a default installation these link to Help, AdminCP, ModCP and others. The footer cannot contain additional modules at this time.

## Quick Setup
The Quick Setup editor offers a few options to help you get your site up and running in as little time as possible. These options come from a variety of the previous tools. Within the Quick Setup, you can upload a new logo, create your first channels and invite people to join your site.
