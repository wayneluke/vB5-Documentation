A script that can test your server capabilities has been provided. You can find this script in the "Do Not Upload" folder of your download package. It can also be downloaded from the vBulletin.com site [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/go/vbtest "Download the vBulletin Server Test Script").

To get started, you will need to upload this script to your server via S/FTP or SCP. Once uploaded, you can load the script in your browser from the address where you uploaded it.

The test script will attempt connect to the database on your server using the information you provide and then will test the PHP environment to see if it meets the necessary requirements.

Once you have a web hosting package meeting the minimum requirements, you are ready to proceed with vBulletin. For help in finding an appropriate web hosting company, please view our [_Hosting Options_](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?11-vBulletin-Hosting-Options "Hosting Options on vBulletin.com") forum.
