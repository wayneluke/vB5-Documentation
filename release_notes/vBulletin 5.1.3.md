We're proud to announce the release of vBulletin 5.1.3. This is a maintenance release focused on resolving issues within the software. All together over 238 issues have been resolved in vBulletin 5.1.3 Connect. We've also fixed issues with PHP 5.5.X and PHP 5.6.X in this release. Most of the issues resolved deal with the internal workings of the software. However there are a few visible changes.

[b]Pagination[/b]
In addition to the pagination in the floating filter bar, many pages throughout the system have had page navigation added at the bottom of the page. This navigation is in line with the page number based navigation that customers have been asking for.
The following locations have been affected:

[b]AdminCP Style[b]
The CSS applied to the AdminCP has been updated to improve readability and usability based on customer feedback. You can view screenshots here: http://tracker.vbulletin.com/browse/VBV-12728

[b]Customer Feedback[/b]
We're continuing to make a number of improvements to the look and feel of the software based on customer feedback. These are often small tweaks and fixes to the layout that may not be immediately apparent. In vBulletin 5.1.4, these include removing the border radius on the lower corners of the footer, adjustments to post display including a line between the signature and post content. The Page Manager in Site Builder has been renamed Channel Manager to more accurately reflect its purpose.
