### File Cleanup

With each version release, some files become obsolete. This is mainly the Javascript Rollup files which are version stamped. However, occasionally PHP files will be refactored and removed from the distribution package. After upgrading your vBulletin system, you should delete any possible obsolete files. You can obtain more information on why this is needed and instructions on how to do this in this [**topic**](https://www.vbulletin.com/forum/node/4391346) in the vBulletin 5 Installs & Upgrades forum.
