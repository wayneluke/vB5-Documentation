vBulletin 5.4.2 Alpha 4 is now available to licensed customers. This is a development release and should not be used in production environments.

[h=2]Global Palette[/h]
This new set of thirteen style variables will allow you to quickly and easily create new basic styles. Through inheritance and carefully crafted algorithms, the changes made here are applied throughout the site while maintaining hue changes as closely as possible. Each of the new variables includes a description that details which items it affects in your Style. For fine-tuning, all the other style variables are still available.

[h=2]Dark Theme[/h]
Building on the recent style work that we have completed, we are introducing a Dark Theme. This theme is a great starting point for gaming and technology sites. Though it can be used for any type of vBulletin site. The new theme takes advantage of SVG Icons, CSS Gradients and the new Global Palette to provide an all-encompassing experience.

[h=2]Google Login[/h]
Google has been added to the list of Third-Party Login Providers. This is implemented as an Addon Product within the vBulletin download. This will allow it to behave like the Twitter login functionality added in vBulletin 5.4.1.
