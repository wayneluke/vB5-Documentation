# Sprite Image.
The sprite for most icons used in a vBulletin Style has been converted to the SVG Image Format and stored as a template in the Style System. 
Advantages of SVG
- Vector Images - They should work equally well at different screen sizes without the need for multiple image files.
- As a vBulletin Administrator you can change the colors of the icons to match your Style using Style Variables.
- Each image can be referenced by a unique ID.
- Sprites are actually XML files so you can easily update images in the download version.

## New Style Variables
New style variables have been added to the system to control the colors of the SVG icons. These are:
- icon_color_1
- icon_color_2

# Tabbed Navigation
The way vBulletin chooses which tab to highlight is based on the URL used by the page. In previous versions, this only handled a few distinct URLs. This means the tab highlighting didn't work on custom pages or "sub-pages" all the time. There can also be problems if you change the default page of your vBulletin Site.

The system has been updated to handle these issues. This allows you to show highlight tabs and show sub-navigation for your custom pages. To do this, the url of your pages should match these formats:

/custompage - highlights the tab assigned to this url. The appropriate sub-navigation will appear as well.
/custompage/subpage - looks for a tab assigned to this URL. If not found, will highlight the tab assigned to the parent "/custompage". If found, it will highlight the tab and show the appropriate sub-navigation.

Google Recaptcha

We encourage people who are still using it to upgrade to Recaptcha version 2 (https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/) as soon as possible.
