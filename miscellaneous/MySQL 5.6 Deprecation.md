# MySQL 5.6 Deprecation

As MySQL 5.6 inches towards end of life, we encourage everyone to upgrade to MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2+. While vBulletin will remain functional using these older versions for the time being, support for them may be dropped in the future without further notice.

Please watch the Minimum Requirements for vBulletin in our standard release announcements as well as in this [forum topic](https://forum.vbulletin.com/node/4387853).
