### Introducing PHAR

PHP contains a feature called PHAR, which stands for **PH**p **AR**chive, that allows developers to package entire directories or applications into a single file. PHAR is similar to a ZIP or TAR file but includes executable PHP. This functionality is being added to vBulletin 5.4.5. In this version, we have added a download option to have the `/core/vb/` directory converted into a PHAR file. This saves several megabytes from the total space needed for files and allows easier uploads to your server.
