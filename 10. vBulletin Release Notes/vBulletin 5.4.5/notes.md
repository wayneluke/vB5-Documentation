# vBulletin 5.4.5 Release Notes

vBulletin 5.4.5 is now available to all customers.

## Improvements

### Improved Font Handling

We've updated the CSS to handle fonts better. All fonts are now inherited from the body_font style variable. This allows you more control over the display of the site while still allowing you to customize your site.

### Reduced Download Size

You can download now download vBulletin with the engine in an PHAR format. PHAR is similar to a ZIP file and allows us to compress the size of the download without sacrificing functionality. Currently, the /core/vb/ directory is compressed and this will reduce the file download by 3 GB.

## Bug Fixes

### Upgrade Memory Handling

The handling of memory during upgrades has been reworked to provide a more robust system. 


## System

- Minimum PHP: 7.1
