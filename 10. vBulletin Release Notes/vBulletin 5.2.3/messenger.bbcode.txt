With the release of vBulletin 5.2.3, we are launching the software's new chat capability, vBulletin Messenger. This new function provides a highly streamlined way for users to communicate with one another. Users will be able to use quick-loading AJAX-based chat windows to have virtually real-time conversations with others in your community. Chat is particularly popular among Millennials and especially well-suited for use on mobile devices.

vBulletin Messenger is likely to increase engagement within your community, encouraging users to stay on your site longer and come back more frequently. Active chats are displayed in a windowed interface. These messages can include images, emoticons, attachments and rich text. You can enable multiple users in individual chats, based on your private messenger permissions.

[h2]Using vBulletin Messenger[/h2]
vBulletin Messenger allows you to chat with one or more users provided the Administrator has turned it on in the AdminCP and given your usergroup permissions to use the functionality.

[B]Accessing vB Messenger[/B]
Users can currently access vBulletin Messenger in two ways.
[LIST]
[*]By clicking on the chat bubble icon next to the user's name in posts.
[*]By selecting a chat discussion from the Messages drop down in the header of the page.
[/LIST] 

Every new private message discussion can be accessed in the vBulletin Messenger system. Each Messenger Discussion will be opened in its own windows. The number of participants allowed is controlled by the Usergroup Permission controlling how many other people can be messaged at once. Once a Messenger window has been opened, users have access to the full Editor menu to craft and send their messages.

[h2]Administrator Controls[/h2]
[B]Enabling vBulletin Messenger[/B]
vBulletin Messenger is turned off by default.You can turn this feature on by setting the option "Enable vB Messenger" to yes. This option can be found under Settings > Options > Private Messaging Options

[B]Usergroup Control[/B]
Administrators can control which usergroups can use vBulletin Messenger using Usergroup Permissions. This would be a great bonus to the premium subscriptions on your site. To set this permission go to Usergroups > Usergroup Manager in the AdminCP. Edit the Usergroup you want to change, and set Can Use vB Messenger to yes. Please note, that all usergroups should have this enabled by default. If you want to restrict access, you will want to adjust these permissions before turning it on globally as mentioned above.

[B]Options[/B]
vBulletin Messenger comes with a few options to control its impact on your server. With the default options, the end-users browser will poll the server regularly to see if there are new messages to display. After a period of inactivity, the browser will stop this polling until the user becomes active again. You can control these values under Settings > Options > Private Messaging Options. The defaults are pretty conservative but provide a robust user experience.
[LIST]
[*][B]vB Messenger Header Polling Interval[/B] (default 30 seconds) - This option determines how often the system checks to see if a new chat request has come in.
[*][B]vB Messenger Window Minimum Polling Interval[/B] (default 1 second) - This value determines the fastest interval that the chat window checks for new messages.
[*][B]vB Messenger Window Maximum Polling Interval[/B] (default 30 seconds) - This value determines the slowest interval that the chat window checks for new messages.
[*][B]vB Messenger Window Idle Timeout[/B] (default 300 seconds) - After a period of inactivity, the chat window will stop polling the server for new messages. This option controls that. When the window times out, the end-user will see a prompt asking if they want to continue chatting.
[/LIST] Look at the inline help within the AdminCP for more information on these options.
