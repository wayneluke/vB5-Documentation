# Introducing vBulletin Mobile 2.0 for iOS

We're proud to announce vBulletin Mobile 2.0 for iOS devices. Similar to the Android app, the IOS App has has been completely reworked with a new modern interface. In addition to this, several changes have been made to the vBulletin Web API to allow for a smoother user experience overall.

## Infinite Scrolling

When using the Activity Stream, the app will automatically load the next page of activity when you scroll to the bottom. This will allow quicker access to content on your site.

## Privacy Support

The app will support the Privacy Options in vBulletin Connect 5.4.3 and higher. This will allow you to comply with a number of different Privacy Laws. When Privacy is configured in your vBulletin AdminCP, the app will adapt and provide the appropriate UI so that users can provide consent.
