The vBulletin Styles system is the interface through which you can configure the way that your visitors see your board. A variety of controls are available for your use, allowing you to make both minor changes, such as the font used for the interface, right through to changing the underlying HTML used to generate the board's individual pages. The look of your board can be altered to your own custom preferences through a simple-to-use interface that allows you to change fonts, colors and images etc. If you want to get down and dirty with the underlying HTML of the board, you can also do this by editing individual templates via the Style Manager.

A vBulletin style comprises several elements that work together to create a complete look and feel for your board.
