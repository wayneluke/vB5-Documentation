## What is a Page?
Pages make up the display system of vBulletin 5 Connect. They allow you to preset the data stored in your database in a way that users can understand. With Pages, you can change the [layout](/site_builder/pages/layouts) of your site or display additional information using [modules](/site_builder/pages/modules). In addition to a number of default pages, vBulletin 5 Connect provides tools to create, edit, and control pages on your site. 

## Page Components
There are two types of pages available in vBulletin 5 Connect at this time.
- System Pages: When you first install vBulletin 5 Connect, system pages will be created. These contain all the necessary functionality of vBulletin 5 Connect.
- Custom Pages: These are the pages, administrators add to the site. Anyone with permission to use Site Builder can edit pages.

Each page is made up of a number of items.
- Title: The title that you want the page known by. This will be used in the &lt;title&gt; tag when the page is shown to the end user.
- URL / Route: This is how vBulletin will find the page.
- Meta Description: This is the page's description. It will be used by search engines if no other appropriate content can be found on the page.
- Template: After you create a layout with the modules you want, you will store this as a template. This allows you to reuse this combination later. vBulletin will use the template to draw the page. 
- Layout: Layouts determine how many columns a page has. There can be from one to three columns. Layouts with columns set to a variety of widths.
- Section: These are areas where you can place modules within a page. There can be up to 5 sections on a page. The number of sections is determined by the layout. Each page contains two special sections. These are above and below the layout columns and can be used for full width content such as advertising. Each section will be border by a dotted line while editing the page.
- Modules: Modules are used to display content on a page. They can contain node content, page information, or other information. Modules width will be limited to the width of the section they are placed in.

## Pages, Edit Page, New Page
The Site Builder Menu provides three tools to work with Pages on your site. These are:
- Pages: A Page Manager for your pages. All custom pages will be listed here so that you can travel to them in order to use the Edit Page tool if you wish. This will come in handy if you forget the URL to a page that you created.
- Edit Page: Allows you to edit the current page you are viewing. This allows you to change the layout or to modify modules.
- New Page: Allows you to create a new Page with a blank canvas.
