The Channel Manager allows you to add, delete and reorganize the channels on your site. Channels are the containers that hold your content. Currently, there are four different types of channels available. These are Article, Forum, Blogs, and Social Group Channels. The Channel Manager primarily focuses on Forum Channels. Of these channel types, Articles and Forums can only be created by site administrators with the appropriate permissions. Blogs and Social Groups can be created by any user with the appropriate permissions. You can manage user permissions from within the Usergroup Manager in the AdminCP.
