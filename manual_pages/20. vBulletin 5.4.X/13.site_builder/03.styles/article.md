The Style tool allows you to select a pre-existing theme for use on your site and sets it as the default. It also allows you to apply CSS customizations to your site.

## Themes

The Theme Selection tool will show all Styles installed in your vBulletin Site. Selecting one of the themes shown will provide a preview image and select it. If you decide that you do not like it, simply select a new theme. Your selection is saved when you click the <button>Save Changes</button>.
