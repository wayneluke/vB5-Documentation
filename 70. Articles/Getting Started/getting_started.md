# Getting Started with vBulletin 5

## Introduction

Congratulations on successfully installing your new vBulletin site! If this is your first time using one of our products (or vBulletin 5), this guide will help you get things set up. Let’s begin with a few definitions.

When you first install your vBulletin, your site loads with the preset style and page like so:

As you can see, it’s already been pre-populated with a page and some modules. A page is
exactly that, a page. It displays your site to users and is a container for modules. Modules are pieces of functionality that you can add, customize, and, sometimes, remove from a page. These modules can cover such functionality as displaying ads, to announcements, to videos and even videos.

Everything displayed in vBulletin 5 is a module of some type. There are two types of modules: normal modules and system modules. The main difference between the two is that you’re unable to delete system modules. This is functionality that you wouldn’t want removed from your site to begin with, such as private messages, advanced search and registration forms.

Now that we have the basic terms down for vBulletin 5, we’ll move on to the how they work and how you can use them, starting with creating pages.

## Editing and Creating Pages

You can edit all default pages in addition to adding more pages to meet the needs of your site. In order to edit an existing page, activate the Site Builder by click on the the Off button in the upper right hand corner of your navigation bar.

Once you’ve activated the Site Builder function, navigate to the page that you want to edit and click Edit Page button.
This opens a form like the one below.

### Add Modules Tab

There are four tabs in the form. The first (the Add Modules) is a catalogue of modules that you can add to the selected page to customize the look and feel of it. Each, as we mentioned, has a different function. Here’s a short list of what they do:

- Activity Stream - A module that tracks and displays the activity on your board. Also
contains the directory for any channels created on the page.
- Ad - A module that organizes and rotates the ads on a site.
- Announcement - A module that manages and displays announcements and notices to
your users.
- Container Module - A module that other modules are moved into so regular users can
interact with them but moving or minimizing its contents.
- Online Users - A modules that displays the number of users online at any given time.
- Search - A module that displays a customized set of search results as a feed.
- Static HTML - A module that displays custom HTML.
- Tag Cloud - A module that displays a clickable list of tags used on the site.
- Today’s Birthday - A module that displays the usernames of user’s with birthdays on
any given day.
- Top Active Users - A module that displays a list of the top active users.
- Video - A module that embeds a video on to a page.

To put a module on a page, click and drag it from the menu onto the page itself. You can use the same method to rearrange the order of the modules on a page. To delete a module, click on the trash can icon to the right of the module title. To edit the module, click on the pencil. A form will open similar to the one below:

A number of fields will be available in the form for you to edit and change. To save the changes you have made for the module, click on the Save button at the bottom of the dialog.

### Change Layout Tab

The Change Layout Tab is the second of the four tabs. This controls the number of columns on a page and the percentage of space each column takes up.

### Select Template Tab

Templates are the saved designs for the default pages and any pages that you create. This can be especially helpful when you have several pages using the same template that requires a change that affects them all.

## Adding a Page

To add a page to your site, follow the same steps as we listed at the top of this section, but instead of clicking on the Edit Page button, click on the New Page button instead.

## Linking to the a New Page

To link your newly created page in the navigation bar, navigate to the page and copy the address to your clipboard. Click on the Navigation Bar button. A form like the one below will open:

Decide if you want the link to be a main navigation item or a sub-navigation item. 

If the link is a sub-navigation item, click on the carat to the far right of the main navigation item you want it nested beneath. Click either the New Navigation Item or the New Sub Navigation Item.

Enter in the name of the link in the Navigation Item Name field and then paste the address your copied into the Target URL before clicking the Save button. Once that’s one, your link will appear in column it was added to. To change it’s position, click and drag it to its new location.

Finally, click Save Changes and confirm your changes. If you do not take this step, the changes will be lost.

## Creating Your First Forum and Subforum

Your vBulletin installation comes with a pre-generated forum. To add more forums, turn on your Site Builder and click on the Page Manager button. This opens a form like the one below:

### Adding a Top-Level Forum

From here, enter the name of the of forum you want to create in the New Forum text box and click Add. It will appear beneath the pre-generated Main Forum. You can change it’s position by clicking on the dotted strip to the left of the forum name and dragging it to its new location.

If you want to delete the forum, click the red x icon to the right of the plus symbol. A confirmation popup will appear. Clicking Yes will complete the deletion. Be careful of which forums you delete, since any threads, posts, and replies in that forum will be removed along with its parent.

### Creating a Category

A category is a container for forums and largely used to organize the forums into, well, different categories. To make a category, click on the Make Category link to the right of the forum you wish to be a category. It will be instantly changed to a category. If you want to change it back, just click the Make Forum link that has taken it’s place. It’s that simple.

### Adding a Sub-Forum

Sub-forums are forums that are nested in parent forums. Usually, this is used to create an area for specific aspects of the topic covered by the larger forum to be discussed. If you want to create sub-forum, click on the plus symbol between the Make Category link and the red x icon. A field such as as the one below will appear:

Enter the name of the new forum in the field that reads New Channel before clicking away from the sub-forum. It’s that simple.

## Setting Up User Registration

With everything set up for your site, it’s now time to take a look at your User Registration settings. Stay in the AdminCP and click on the Settings header, followed by the Options link. Once the vBulletin Options form loads, select the User Registration Options from the scrolling list and click the Edit Settings button:
The following form will load:

This controls every aspect of user registration for your site. It includes everything from whether or not it’s turned on, to COPPA Registration, to Welcome Messages. For a full list of options and what they do, go to:

## Setting Up Human Verification

There are some sections of the site and its functionality that you’ll want to have human verification for. To turn on Human Verification, click on the Settings header in the AdminCP, followed by the Options link. Once the vBulletin Options form loads, select the Human Verification Options from the scrolling list and click the Edit Settings button.

Checking an option will activate it, while unchecking the option will deactivate it. This means that any usergroup that has the option Require Human Verification on Configure Actions activated will need to verify that they’re human when interacting with the selected options. Once you’re done, click Save and the changes you’ve made will be applied to the site.
