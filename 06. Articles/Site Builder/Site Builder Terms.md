# Site Builder Terminology

## Channel

A channel is a container that allow you to organize nodes across your site. vBulletin ships with four types of configurable channels - Forums, Articles, Blogs, and Social Groups. You can make as many channels as you desire. However, each new channel requires additional resources and too many channels may make your site difficult to navigate.

## Page

A page is the content area that visitors see when they visit a URL on your site. Each page is made up of a Layout, Page Template and one or more Modules. Each Page also includes the header, footer and navigation when it is rendered.

### Layout

The layout defines the number of columns and sections available on a page. vBulletin Connect offers layouts for one, two and three columns. Each column is a fixed percentage of the entire width of a page.

### Modules

Modules are areas of content that can be placed on a page. Module are placed within the different sections to build the page. These can provide the results of pre-defined searches, custom HTML content, advertising, and more. Each module on the page requires additional resources to be processed.

### Template

A template is a combination of the Layout and Modules. This is the primary structure of a Page. Templates can be saved and reused. All pages that utilize a specific template will also inherit the modules and settings saved within that template.

## Style

Styles define the look and feel of pages and determine what the user sees. Within Site Builder, you can choose between a variety of pre-existing Themes and add custom CSS.

### Themes

Themes are specialized vBulletin Styles that allow quick application of style changes for a cohesive look across your entire vBulletin Connect Website.

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a display language that tells the browser how to display each page. CSS is used by the Theme to give each page its form, color, and appearance.

## Header

The header is the top of your page. It contains the logo, search bar and optional advertising locations.

## Footer

The footer is the bottom of the page. It can be customized to add custom navigation links.

## Navigation

Your site navigation sits directly under the header. It can be customized to show a two level navigation bar made up of Tabs and Sub-navigation for each tab. The navigation also contains the pre-defined breadcrumbs and any active notices when the page is rendered.

## Additional Terms

### JSON

JSON is data structure that creates parsable arrays. It is used to structure search filters within a search module. It is also used by pages to talk to the server and receive information back to determine what displayed to the user.
