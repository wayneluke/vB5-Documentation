We're proud to announce the release of vBuleltin 5.1.2. This is a maintenance release focused on resolving ongoing issues within the software. This release brings an update to the editor for better browser support, Administrator Selectable Themes, and Custom CSS editing in Site Builder along with resolving over 170 issues in the software. 

ckEditor 4.3.3
We've updated the editor built into vBulletin 5. This resolves a number of issues that occurred in several browsers including IE11. While there are no functional changes in the editor within vBulletin, this update brings crucial bug fixes to the product.

Themes
Themes are a new type of Stylevar and limited CSS only style that can be distributed to users and used on sites. While originally designed for vBulletin Cloud Users, they are available for all customers. Themes can be shared among users. We will also provide a variety of themes to choose. Available theme selection can be expanded over time.

Custom CSS in Site Builder.
In conjunction with Themes, you can now edit your custom CSS within Site Builder without having to visit the AdminCP. Any CSS can be placed in the CSS editor and saved for the current Style that is active. This is another feature built for vBulletin Cloud but available to all customers. This editing should make it easier to apply quick CSS tweaks to your site.

Below you will find the issues resolved in this release and a list of updated template.
